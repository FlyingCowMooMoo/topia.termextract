This is a fork of [topia.termextract](https://github.com/turian/topia.termextract) to make this library compatible with Python 3

The `interface.implements()` from zopia is deprecated and should now use the `@implementer` annotation

To install, simple add the following to your `requirements.txt` file
```git+git://github.com/PeteShag/topia.termextract.git```

or to install using `pip` run the following:
